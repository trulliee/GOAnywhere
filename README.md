# GoAnywhere 🚦🗺️

GoAnywhere is a Final Year Project mobile app that explores the integration of navigation, traffic prediction, and reporting tools into one platform. While not a production-ready solution, it reflects our hands-on learning in full-stack development, machine learning deployment, and mobile application design.

## 🚀 Overview

This app provides a set of isolated features, including:

- Point-to-point **navigation** (driving & public transport) using Google Maps API
- **Saved locations** and **location history** (occasionally buggy)
- Experimental **traffic congestion** and **travel time prediction** (limited accuracy)
- **User feedback system** on predictions
- A simple **weather page**
- **Traffic incident reporting**
- A **basic admin panel** for user management and data viewing

⚠️ **Note**: Features do not interact with each other — predictions, reports, and navigation function independently.

## ❗ Known Issues

- Traffic predictions are **frequently inaccurate**
- All features are **isolated**, not dynamically connected
- Location history has **inconsistent performance**
- Admin sees reports only as **lat/lon coordinates**

## 🎓 Purpose

This project was developed for academic purposes as part of a final year module. It served as a hands-on platform to learn:
- Cloud deployment (GCP, Firebase)
- Full-stack development and API integration
- Machine learning model serving and feedback collection
- Mobile UI/UX design using React Native
